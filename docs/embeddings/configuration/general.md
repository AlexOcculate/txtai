# General

General configuration options that don't fit elsewhere.

## format
```yaml
format: pickle|json
```

Sets the configuration storage format. Defaults to `pickle`.

## autoid
```yaml
format: int|uuid function
```

Sets the auto id generation method. When this is not set, an autogenerated numeric sequence is used. This also supports [UUID generation functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html#uuid.uuid1). For example, setting this value to `uuid4` will generate random UUIDs. Setting this to `uuid5` will generate deterministic UUIDs for each input data row.
